# Learning complexity gradually in quantum machine learning models
In this project we try different optimization methods inside the curriculum learning umbrella, applying them to a parametrized quantum circuit. You can find the paper in [arxiv](hola.com).

In this repository you will find all the functions and scripts used for the simulation of the quantum circuits and their optimization with Curriculum Learning. In order to run the optimization, you hav to run the file main.py. At the start, set all the hyperparameter settings as you want and then run the script. This will create all the data csv and the loss plots
